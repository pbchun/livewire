### The Problems:

Small venues have don't have the budget for event managers. They want the best acts to suit their venue's personality, but it's often difficult to get out there and find them.

Stuggling artists also have a hard time getting opportunities at the venues they feel will give them the best possible platform.

Event goers need a central location to see schedules of events at their favorite venues, along with media to determine if an event is up their alley.

### The Solution:

LIVEWIRE is a 3-in-1 small venue event management service, benefitting venues, artists, and event goers. Venue Management can post their available dates, then artists can request to book these dates by providing their information, including media of their act. If approved, these acts are posted publicly on the venue's event page for the world to see, along with media to promote the act. Great for comedy clubs, nightclubs, coffee shops, bars, or any business that likes to bring in talent to perform
