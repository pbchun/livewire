## Galvanize Unity

Working in an instructor-assigned group of 3-5 people, you will build a full-stack application. Your application should include:

- Front-end
- Back-end
- Database
- At least one library
- Tests

What the application does is up to your group!

### Before

Write a proposal to the instructors using [this template](project-proposal.md). Do not start working until your project proposal is approved!

### During

Use an agile process to complete the project. Specifically, work in _features_, not _layers_. Some common pitfalls:

- Building all of the back-end, and then building all of the front-end (or vice-versa)
- Styling everything at once at the end instead of as you're building the features
- Not deploying until the end
- Doing a half-baked version of every feature instead of doing complete versions of some of the features

If you do this correctly, you should have something working and deployed on the first day.

During each day of your project, you need to:

- Do some pair-programming
- Hold at least one inclusive meeting, and add notes about the things you talk about and decide [here](meeting-notes.md)
- Develop your code using a team git workflow

### After

Put together a 3-5 minute presentation of your project, which should include the following:

- A slide deck
- A demo of your application
- Everyone in your group should speak

Put a link to your deployed app [here]() and links to your codebase [here]()
